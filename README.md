# Generic Matrix Library in C++ 
<br>

Currently there is support for <br>

1. Initialization using vecotrs,other matrices.
2. Initialization using copy constructor and identity matrix.
3. Iterator support. 2 types (row major iteration and column major iteration)
4. Resize
5. Append row/column
6. Indexing operator []
7. Equality Operators == and !=
8. Cout << operator
9. Matrix Multiplication
10. Matrix Addition
11. Matrix Subtraction
12. Power of Matrix
13. Matrix Inverse
14. Matrix Transpose
15. Matrix Determinant
16. Adjoint of a matrix
17. Cofactor of a matrix
18. Display function
19. Scalar Addition, Multiplication, Subtraction and Division

To use this library include the `matrix_library.h` file in your code. <br>
Execution is done in `execute.cpp` <br>

To start the execution type<br> 
`make`
`./matrix`
<br>
Matrices used are present in `containers_input.txt` and `operations_input.txt`. 
<br>To test on your own matrices, please change the matrix in those respective files <br>
